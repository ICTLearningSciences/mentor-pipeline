00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.970
My name is EMC Clint Anderson, that's Electrician's Mate Clinton Anderson.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.100
 I was born in Los Angeles, California. I was raised there most

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.230
 of my life and I graduated from high school there. A couple of years

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.350
 after graduating from high school, then I joined the United States

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.470
 Navy. I was an Electrician's Mate for eight years. I served on an aircraft

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.600
 carrier. We went on many deployments. A deployment is when you

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.730
 go to war, you fight. We fought in the Iraq war. I went on three deployments

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.850
 and it was a really great time in my life. I had a lot of

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.970
 fun. At the end of the eight years, I decided that the Navy wasn't

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.100
 quite a career for me. So, I got out of the Navy. I started using the

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.230
 education benefits that we received and I started going to the University

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.350
 of California at Berkeley. I was majoring in computer science

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.470
 and afterwards, I started getting my master's degree from the University

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.600
 of Southern California. I also had a job at the Institute for

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.730
 Creative Technologies. It's been a lot of fun, this whole time. Thanks

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.850
 to the Navy.
